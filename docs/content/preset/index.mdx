## Contributing

Work with two terminals. In the first terminal run

    yarn workspace @undataforum/preset run watch

and in the second terminal run

    yarn workspace docs run dev

The first command watches for changes in the `@undataforum/preset` workspace and
bundles the `@undataforum/preset` package whenever it detects changes. The
second command launches the docs, which use the local `@undataforum/preset`
package as dependency.
